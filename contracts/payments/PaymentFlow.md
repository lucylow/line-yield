# LINE YIELD Payment & Settlement System

## Payment Flow Architecture

### 1. Payment Processing Flow

```
User (DApp) → LINE NEXT → 3rd Party Processor → Settlement
```

#### Step-by-Step Process:

1. **Payment Request Initiation**

   - DApp creates payment request with amount, currency, and metadata
   - Request sent to LINE NEXT for approval

2. **LINE NEXT Integration**
   - LINE NEXT receives payment request
   - User approves payment through LINE interface
   - LINE NEXT processes payment and returns result
   - Payment status updated in DApp

3. **Third-Party Payment Processor**
   - LINE NEXT forwards payment to 3rd party processor
   - Processor handles actual payment execution
   - Payment confirmation sent back through chain

4. **Settlement Process**
   - 3rd party processor settles with LINE NEXT
   - LINE NEXT converts to USDT via OTC partners
   - USDT transferred to user's wallet
   - Settlement confirmation sent to DApp
